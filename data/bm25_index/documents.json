    "text": "After completion of 1 month, in weekly stage review if such security s close to close positive price variation is less than 15  in a month, it can move to stage 1 of the Framework. Securities completing 90 calendar days  subject to meeting of aforesaid condition in point no. 2.3.2  in the framework shall be eligible for stage-wise exit subject to such securities not meeting the entry criteria. Note: The Price Band of a scrip moving out of the framework shall be reinstated to the Price Band applicable to that scrip before it got shortlisted under the respective framework. This will be subject to the scrip not being shortlisted or part of any other Surveillance measure, in which case, the price band of the relevant surveillance framework will prevail. Should shortlisting under ESM be construed as an adverse action against the concerned company   entity? The shortlisting of securities under ESM is purely on account of market surveillance and it should not be construed as an adverse action against the concerned company   entity. Some of the securities which have been identified under ESM are already under various surveillance actions mentioned in the ESM framework. What does this mean? As stated, ESM framework shall work in addition to existing actions undertaken by the Exchange on the company s securities. In case the securities are already attracting any action mentioned in ESM framework, then such action shall continue to work in conjunction with appropriate action under ESM framework. Where do I get the complete list of securities under ESM? A file  esm-latest.csv  containing securities under ESM is available on our website at the following link: https:  www.nseindia.com reports esm Market Participants are requested to refer the latest circulars issued by the Exchange with respect to Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure  ESM . The circulars are available on our website at the following link: https:  www.nseindia.com resources exchange-communication-circulars Is market capitalization considered for entry exit or both in ESM framework? Market Capitalization is used only for inclusion in ESM framework and the same is not considered as a criterion for exit from the framework. Are newly listed securities eligible for Inclusion in ESM framework? Yes, all newly listed securities on the Mainboard SME segment with market cap of less than 1000 crore are eligible for Inclusion in ESM framework.",
